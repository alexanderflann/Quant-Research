# Quant-Research

This repository contains a collection of short research notes, modelling experiments, and code‑driven mini‑projects in quantitative finance. Each piece focuses on a specific concept or technique, presented in a concise and accessible format. Topics include areas which are aligned with my academic work and personal interest in quantitative finance.

The aim of this blog is to build a consistently updated portfolio that demonstrates practical engagement with mathematical finance, numerical methods, and computational modelling. Notes are written in Markdown and/or PDF format, with accompanying code where relevant.

# Purpose

This repository serves as a space to document my independent learning, explore quantitative ideas beyond formal coursework, and develop a clear, reproducible record of modelling work. It reflects my ongoing commitment to building strong foundations in quantitative finance and computational methods.
